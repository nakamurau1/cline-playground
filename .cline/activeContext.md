# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on initializing the Memory Bank system for the Cline Playground. This involves setting up the core documentation structure that will support future experiments and demonstrations.

## Recent Changes
- Created the basic repository structure
- Initialized the Memory Bank with core documentation files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md (this file)
  - progress.md

## Next Steps
- Consider specific experiments or demonstrations to add to the playground
- Potentially enhance the README.md with more detailed information
- Explore different Cline capabilities through targeted examples
- Document interactions and learnings from using Cline

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Memory Bank Structure**: The current Memory Bank follows the standard structure but may be extended with additional context files as specific needs emerge
- **Documentation Approach**: Focusing on clear, concise documentation that will serve as a reference for both current and future interactions
- **Exploration Strategy**: Planning to build from simple to more complex demonstrations to showcase Cline's capabilities
- **Learning Focus**: Emphasizing the documentation and memory aspects of Cline as a key differentiator from other AI assistants
