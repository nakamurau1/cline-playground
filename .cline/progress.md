## What's Left to Build
- ðŸ“‹ Specific example projects showcasing different Cline capabilities
- ðŸ“‹ Enhanced README with usage instructions
- ðŸ“‹ Sample workflows demonstrating Memory Bank usage patterns
- ðŸ“‹ Different types of development tasks to showcase versatility

## Known Issues
- None at present, as the project is in its initial setup phase

## Milestones
- [x] Initialize repository
- [x] Set up Memory Bank structure
- [ ] Create first demonstration example
- [ ] Document learnings from initial experiments
- [ ] Develop more complex examples showcasing advanced features

## Next Actions
1. Identify specific capabilities of Cline to demonstrate
2. Create a simple first example to test Memory Bank continuity
3. Document the process and learnings
4. Plan subsequent examples with increasing complexity
