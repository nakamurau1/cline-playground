# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
This playground repository may incorporate various technologies based on specific experiments and demonstrations, but the core technologies include:

- **Git**: Version control for the repository
- **Markdown**: Used for all Memory Bank documentation
- **Cline AI**: The primary AI assistant being tested and utilized

Depending on the specific experiments, additional technologies may include:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- Node.js
- Python
- Various frameworks and libraries

## Development Setup
The minimal setup required to use this playground includes:

1. **Git**: For cloning and managing the repository
2. **Text Editor/IDE**: VS Code is recommended for optimal Cline integration
3. **Cline Integration**: Properly configured access to Cline AI through supported interfaces

Additional setup requirements will be documented within specific experiment directories as needed.

## Technical Constraints
- **Memory Bank Limitations**: Cline's Memory Bank system has specific file structure requirements
- **Context Length**: Cline has finite context windows that may limit the scope of individual interactions
- **Tool Availability**: Available tools may vary based on Cline implementation and configurations

## Dependencies
As a playground, this repository aims to minimize external dependencies to focus on Cline's capabilities. Core dependencies include:

- **Cline AI**: The primary dependency for all interactions
- **Git**: Required for repository management

Specific experiments may introduce additional dependencies, which should be documented within their respective directories.

## Technical Guidelines
- Prefer simplicity and clarity over complexity
- Document all experimental approaches thoroughly
- Include comments that explain the purpose of demonstrations
- Organize code in a way that highlights specific Cline capabilities being demonstrated
